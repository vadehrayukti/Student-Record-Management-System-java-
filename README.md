# Student-Record-Management-System-java-
This project implements a Student Record Management System using java Collections, File Handling, and OOP concepts.   The system loads student data from a file (`students.txt`) at startup and saves updated records back upon exit, ensuring persistent storage.
It uses:

- `ArrayList` to store student records  
- `Comparator` to sort students by marks  
- `Iterator` to display records  
- `File` class to show file attributes  
- `RandomAccessFile` to demonstrate random record reading  

The main functionality includes adding, viewing, searching, deleting, sorting, saving, and randomly accessing student records.

##  **Features Implemented**

###  **Persistent Storage**
- Loads student data from `students.txt` at startup  
- Saves updated records on exit  

###  **Java Collections**
- Uses `ArrayList<Student>` to store data  
- Supports dynamic addition and deletion  

###  **Sorting**
- Sort records by marks using `Comparator<Student>`  

###  **Iterator Usage**
- Displays student data using `Iterator`  

###  **File Handling**
- Uses `File` class to show file size, path, and permissions  
- Uses `RandomAccessFile` for random record access  

###  **Menu-Driven Console Interface**
- Add Student  
- View All Students  
- Search by Name  
- Delete by Name  
- Sort by Marks  
- Save & Exit
